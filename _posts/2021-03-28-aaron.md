Aaron is our guest for this episode of Radio Daal. He was born and raised in **the Netherlands**. He started studying Computer programming and game  development in college, but he dropped it halfway and started working in a werehouse. After a few years he left his country and **moved to Austrialia to live as a backpacker**. It was the beginning of a big journey for him.

I consider myself so lucky that I could meet Aaron. He's so friendly, talking to him is so delightful and most importantly has so many interesting stories to tell. Since he was a already an avid podcast listener, convincing him to participate in one of the episodes was rather easy, and I appreciate his trust in me for being our first non-Farsi speaking guest.
