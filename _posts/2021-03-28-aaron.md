I consider myself so lucky that I could meet Aaron. He's so friendly, talking to him is so delightful and he always has some interesting stories to tell. Since he was a already an avid podcast listener, convincing him to participate in one of the episodes was rather easy, and I appreciate his trust in me for being our first non-Farsi speaking guest.
